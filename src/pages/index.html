                <span class="italic">[Ongoing]</span> Learning to Navigate in Open Urban Environments Using a Simple Sim2Real Strategy
            </h4>
            <p>
                We have designed a unified autonomous navigation framework based on large models that seamlessly integrates indoor and outdoor navigation. This framework is initially trained in a virtual environment and then transferred to real-world scenarios through a sim2real approach. The proposed method has been rigorously tested and validated on Xiaomi's Cyberdog, demonstrating its reliability and effectiveness in real-world open city environment.
